# WoltAssignment Backend task
Made with Ktor server and client
## Installation
Open in IntelliJ Idea (I have used the ultimate version), run with command `./gradlew run`, you can send GET requests on `0.0.0.0:8080` (example url `http://0.0.0.0:8080/discovery?lat=60.1709&lon=24.941`). Also you can run tests from tests.http if you have ultimate version.
